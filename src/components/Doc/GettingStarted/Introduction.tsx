        The Cleverley Lab is led by Dr. Kristin Cleverley, a Canadian expert in child and adolescent mental health transitions. Using a multi-methods approach to research, Dr.
        Cleverley works with a team of staff and students to develop and evaluate interventions that support transitions in care across diverse mental health settings. In
        particular, the Cleverley Lab seeks to improve our understanding of mental health care in order to inform and develop interventions that are proactive, flexible, and
        efficient.

        With extensive collaborations across community and hospital settings, the Cleverley Lab actively partners with youth, caregivers, clinicians, and administrators in all
        aspects of our work. We lead a research program that produces novel clinical and health system interventions to improve continuity of care for youth with mental illness,
        addictions, and concurrent disorders.
