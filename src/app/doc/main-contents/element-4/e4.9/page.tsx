        The transition experience can often be a point of fear or anxiety for youth due to the uncertainty of the process. During this time, youth may benefit from connecting with
        a trained peer support worker who has the skills and shared lived experience to offer emotional support to the youth. Peer support workers can offer helpful coping
        strategies and conduct support meetings to assist youth with the challenges they may face during their transition process.
