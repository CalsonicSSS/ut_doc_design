        Ensure the young person (and <HighlightText content='family members/caregivers' clickToId='gt-fmc' />, where appropriate) is aware of community mental health services
        available to them, the purposes they serve, and how they can be accessed (e.g., walk-in services, phone lines). This should be included in the individualized transition
        plan (see core component 4.5). Note that the appropriate mental health and community supports will depend upon the unique needs of the individual youth as well as the
        specific resources available in their geographic area.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-8'>
        Due to the complex and varying biopsychosocial issues, shifting symptom patterns and presentations, and comorbid diagnoses seen in youth populations, transition pathways
        may look different from person to person{' '}
        <AuthorReference refName='(McGorry et al., 2014)' href='https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(14)00082-0/abstract' />. Not every young person will
        need to transition to adult-oriented mental health services nor require a high intensity transition intervention. For example, alternative transition pathways could include
        access to youth-oriented integrated primary mental health care, establishing “soft entry” by minimizing stigma and other barriers to accessing services, and organizing
        digital support where possible <AuthorReference refName='(McGorry et al., 2022)' href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20938' />
        .Providing youth with access to developmentally appropriate community and health services will ensure they have resources available if they do not transition to adult
        mental health services, withdraw from adult mental health services, or desire only episodic contact with adult mental health services.
