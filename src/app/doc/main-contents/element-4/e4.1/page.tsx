        A designated “most responsible person” should serve as the primary contact person throughout the transition. They are responsible for ensuring{' '}

        A transition navigator is a registered health professional who has expertise in transition coordination and case management, and who provides short term support (often 1-6
        months) during the transition period <AuthorReference refName='(Cleverley et al., 2018)' href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6254258/' />. They work with youth
        (and family/caregivers, if appropriate) and members of the clinical team to identify needs post-discharge and goals for transfer of care. They have a strong understanding
        of community programs and resources and are able to work with youth to identify and connect with appropriate services. They continue to provide support to the youth post
        discharge and throughout the referral and transition to adult services or other appropriate services. They may also provide psychoeducation and some short-term therapeutic
        support while the youth is between services.
