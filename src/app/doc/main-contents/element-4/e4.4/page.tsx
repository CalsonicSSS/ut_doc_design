        It is important to connect with youth well in advance to identify and prepare for a transfer in care. Optimal timing means the individual&apos;s clinical needs are taken
        into account, especially if they are transitioning to a specialized service (e.g., early intervention in psychosis service), or if they are transitioning earlier or later
        than age 18. Discussion with the youth (and family members/caregivers, if appropriate) to educate them on the reason for the timing of the transfer is critical to ensure
        they understand the clinical and/or service rationale. Work with the young person to identify the resources or skills they need to be ready for the agreed upon transition
        time.
