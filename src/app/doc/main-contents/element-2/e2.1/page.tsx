        When preparing youth to transition out of <HighlightText content='child and adolescent mental health services' clickToId='gt-caamhs' /> , there are several factors that
        need to be considered. For many organizations, this transition is age-dependent. For example, some organizations require young adults to transition to adult mental health
        services when they turn 18. Other organizations may specify additional criteria for transitions, such as completing a set number of sessions before transitioning and/or
        receiving a specific psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., psychosis).

        Where possible, the transition identification process should begin at least six months prior to the planned transition. A transition plan should be established during the
        initiation of the transition process (see{' '}
