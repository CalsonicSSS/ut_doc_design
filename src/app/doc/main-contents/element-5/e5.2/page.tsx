        The transfer package should include general information about the young person and their treatment history, as well as any documentation specific to the receiving agency. A
        complete transfer package should support seamless transitions in care and limit the amount of follow up required post transition. A complete transfer package can also
        reduce the burden on the youth to continuously share their story with new care providers.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-6'>
        Where possible, youth should also maintain a copy of their transfer package. This is particularly relevant when a young person only requires episodic care, or if they are
        likely to see a different provider in the future.
