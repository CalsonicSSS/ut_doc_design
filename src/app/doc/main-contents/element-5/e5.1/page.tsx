        The purpose of the meeting should be to develop a shared understanding of the young person&apos;s care up to this point, and their continuing care needs. The meeting can be
        used to identify the roles of everyone involved in the handover of care, based on the previously established care plan. The handover meetings may include everyone
        previously identified as being part of the care transition (i.e., the youth, <HighlightText content='child and adolescent mental health services' clickToId='gt-caamhs' />{' '}
        and <HighlightText content='adult mental health services' clickToId='gt-amhs' /> clinician(s), <HighlightText content='transition navigators' clickToId='gt-tn' />, and{' '}
        <HighlightText content='family members/caregivers' clickToId='gt-fmc' /> if appropriate) It is often organized and led by the{' '}
        <HighlightText content='most responsible provider' clickToId='gt-mrp' /> at that point in time. It is important to ensure youth understand the purpose and goals of the
        meeting,and that they can choose how they would like to be involved. For more information about who should be involved in this meeting, reference the discussion in
        component 4.1 and 4.2.
