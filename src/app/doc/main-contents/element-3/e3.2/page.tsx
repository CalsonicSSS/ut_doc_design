        Youth transitioning from child to adult mental health services are navigating a critical life stage, marked by developmental milestones and new life experiences{' '}
        <AuthorReference refName='(Borah et al., 2021)' href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15332985.2021.1894629' />. These simultaneous changes may further
        complicate health care transitions.

        Youth identified several factors that make transitions difficult, including: uncertainty about the definition of transition and the appropriate age for transfer, a lack of
        transition readiness, limited involvement in the <HighlightText content='transition process' clickToId='gt-tprocess' />, confusion about roles and responsibilities in the
        transition process, and concerns over transition gaps leading to poor mental health outcomes{' '}

      <p className='mb-8'>
        One of the most significant changes these youth face is the stark contrast between the{' '}
        <HighlightText content='child and adolescent mental health services' clickToId='gt-caamhs' /> system and{' '}
        <HighlightText content='adult mental health services' clickToId='gt-amhs' />. Youth have identified decreased support in adult mental health services compared to child and
        adolescent services, and a lack of information sharing between systems. Child and adolescent mental health services are seen as nurturing and family-oriented, whereas adult
        mental health services treat youth as autonomous adults with limited family involvement{' '}

        result in a sudden shift in the type and level of care, increasing the risk of care disengagement{' '}

        the transition process, particularly due to a lack of information about their available options{' '}

        the importance of being active partners in the planning process and ensuring that information about the transition is clearly communicated{' '}
