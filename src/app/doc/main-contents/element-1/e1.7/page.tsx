        It is important to identify key indicators for evaluation early in the process of implementing your organization&apos;s transition protocol (see the “Evaluation” section of
        the transitions workbook for a discussion of different indicator types). This will allow for an understanding of how your transition protocol is impacting transitions in
        your organization. It will also ensure that you are collecting the necessary information to conduct your evaluation.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-6'>
        Your evaluation plan will depend on which transition-related outcomes have been identified as priorities for your organization. For example, if you choose to implement
        transition case conferences (or “warm handover” meetings) as part of your organization&apos;s transition protocol, your evaluation plan might include measuring the
        proportion of transitioning youth who receive a <HighlightText content='warm handover' clickToId='gt-wh' /> ,and/or assessing clinician-reported barriers and facilitators
        to conducting warm handovers.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-8'>
        When developing an evaluation plan, consider how you can collaborate with patients/youth and caregivers to identify priority outcomes and select evaluation methods that
        will best measure their impact. For example, your organization may leverage the expertise of a patient advisory council or create opportunities to conduct focus groups with
        caregivers.
