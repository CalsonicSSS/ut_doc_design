        A youth-centered and developmentally appropriate protocol ensures that mental health care transitions effectively address the unique needs of youth. A developmentally
        appropriate approach prioritizes developmental stage rather than chronological age, recognizing the dynamic nature of adolescence and young adulthood. It ensures that care
        services are defined by the developmental processes shaping these populations{' '}

        Protocols developed in collaboration with partners across care systems can better address barriers to <HighlightText content='continuity of care' clickToId='gt-coc' /> by
        explicitly outlining the expectations and roles of each person involved. Protocols can be revised and adapted over time to reflect everyone’s changing needs, resources, and
        roles.
