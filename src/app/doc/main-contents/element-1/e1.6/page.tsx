        Patient or <span className='font-bold'>youth engagement</span> means working with young people as important partners in their own care. By partnering with youth and their
        families, care providers can better understand the experiences, needs, and priorities of the individual, allowing for more patient-centred and tailored care. During a
        transition in care, this may involve working with youth to identify the resources and transition pathways most important to them, and supporting them in developing
        self-advocacy skills.

      <p className='mb-8'>
        Youth and family engagement is also important at the organizational or program level. Organizations can partner with youth and families to better understand their
        experiences around the transition process. This can help to ensure that transition pathways and policies are more transparent, credible, and responsive.
